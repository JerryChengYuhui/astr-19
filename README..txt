Jerry Cheng Session 1 for Coding Journal 1

This repository contains a Python script that introduces basic variable assignment and string formatting. The script demonstrates how to create variables, assign values to them, and use them to print personalized messages.

Code Explanation

- `name = "Jerry Cheng"`: This line creates a variable named 'name' and assigns it the value "Jerry Cheng".

- `pronouns = "he/him"`: Here, a variable 'pronouns' is created with the value "he/him".

- `favorite_movie = "Fast & Furious 7"`: This line creates a variable 'favorite_movie' with the value "Fast & Furious 7".

- `favorite_food = "burger"`: Lastly, a variable 'favorite_food' is created and assigned the value "burger".

The code then uses f-strings to print messages that include the values of these variables:

- `print(f"My name is {name}.")`: This line prints a message including the 'name' variable's value.

- `print(f"My preferred pronouns are {pronouns}.")`: It prints a message including the 'pronouns' variable's value.

- `print(f"My favorite movie is {favorite_movie}.")`: This line prints a message with the 'favorite_movie' variable's value.

- `print(f"My favorite food is {favorite_food}.")`: Finally, it prints a message including the 'favorite_food' variable's value.
