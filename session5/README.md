## Introduction
This Python program is used to generate a table of `sin(x)` and `x` values, where `x` ranges from 0 to 2, for a total of 1000 data points. The program follows the basic Python program structure, including a main function.

## Program structure
- `generate_sin_table` function: generates values of `x` and `sin(x)`.
- `main` function: the main part of the program, calls `generate_sin_table` and prints the results.
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that the `main` function is executed only when the program is running as the main program.
