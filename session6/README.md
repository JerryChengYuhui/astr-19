Overview
This project demonstrates the basic usage of mathematical functions in Python with Jupyter Notebook. It includes examples of defining functions, documenting them using Markdown, and tabulating function results.

Jupyter notebook basics
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to create notebook documents containing live code, Markdown text, visualizations, and equations.

Main features
Interactive Coding: Run code in blocks or units, useful for testing or developing new code.
Markdown support: Use Markdown to add rich text elements to describe your code and findings.
Inline visualization: Display graphs and charts directly in your notebook.
How to use this notebook
Run a cell: Click the cell and press Shift + Enter to execute code or render Markdown.
Edit code: Click any code cell to start editing.
View output: The output appears directly below the code cell.
Chapters in this notebook
Function Definition: Cells that define the sin and cos functions.
Markdown description: A Markdown cell that explains the purpose and usage of the feature.
Tabulation and Display: Functions in cells tabulate the values and display the first 10 entries.
