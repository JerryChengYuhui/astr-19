Jerry Cheng README for Session 2 Coding Journal 1.

Sum of Two Floating Point Numbers:

The script defines two floating point numbers, float_num1 (5.5) and float_num2 (3.3).
It calculates their sum and prints the result, along with the result's data type.
Difference Between Two Integers:

Two integers, int_num1 (10) and int_num2 (4), are defined.
The script calculates the difference (int_num1 - int_num2) and prints the result with its data type.
Product of a Floating Point Number and an Integer:

The product of float_num1 and int_num1 is calculated.
The script outputs the product and its corresponding data type.
