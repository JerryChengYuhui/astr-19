## Features
The `Cat` class includes the following features:
- Physical attributes of a cat such as arm length, leg length, number of eyes, whether it has a tail, and whether it is furry.
- An initialization method (`__init__`) to set the values of these physical characteristics when a new `Cat` object is created.
- A method (`describe`) to print out the physical characteristics of the cat.

## Usage
To use this class:
1. Create an instance of the `Cat` class by passing the physical attributes to the constructor.
2. Call the `describe` method on the instance to print the cat's physical characteristics.
