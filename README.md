Jerry Cheng Coding Journal 1, Session 3.

- The program starts by defining the function `f(x)`. This function takes a single argument `x` and returns the value of `x**3 + 8`.
- In the main function of the program, `f(x)` is called with `x = 9`.
- The result of `f(9)` is then printed to the console.
- An `if` statement checks if the result is greater than 27. If it is, the program prints "YAY!" to the console.
